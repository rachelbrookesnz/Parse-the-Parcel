# Parse-the-Parcel
Finds a suitable parcel size based on user input

Simple program that reads in file to create a stored list of parcel specifications.
Reads in a user's item sizes and then finds the cheapest suitable parcel size and returns it back to the user.
Inputs (both the file parcels and the user) are sorted smallest to largest to ensure different orientations can still be matched.

If I had more time to work on this solution I would have liked to have added functionality to sort by parcel volume.
I would have then checked to see if I could find the same priced parcel with the smallest suitable volume.
Another cool extention on this would have been to add signing, overnight delivery, and tracking costs.
